# hello-world

Hello! I am DPlaysBass!

I am a person whose brain is too big for just one hobby. Along with my music interests, I am interested in web development, game development, and psychology.

My goal in life is to help people while also being able to do cool stuff; I want to make my own music projects, create cool web pages, and develop games with experiences that haven't been done before.

Please note that I am still learning. Game design takes a lot of practice to nail down. :\

I hope that my projects will make people happy, and GitHub is the first place to start.
